I pulled data from Radius Space's [Nanosatellite Database](www.nanosats.eu) on April 20, 2016. To do so, I selected the data from the multipage database and transfered it to Open Office. After cleaning up the formatting, I saved the resulting files to a CSV format. I used Open Office because there was no simple alternative for cleaning up the files quickly. The Nanosatellite Database has no export features and was proving difficult to scrape.
   
Below are the simple steps for combining the datasets I gathered into more useful structures for assignments
   
```{r warning=FALSE}
# Create a single CSV containing all the data I pulled

# First, place all files that need to be merged into a merge folder (e.g. "mergeme") and set the working directory to that folder
setwd("/Users/dainabouquin/Documents/CUNYsps_MS/IS_608_all/IS_608/NanosatDB_munging/mergeme")

# create list of file neames
filenames=list.files(path="/Users/dainabouquin/Documents/CUNYsps_MS/IS_608_all/IS_608/NanosatDB_munging/mergeme", full.names=TRUE)
# use lapply to apply read.csv() to the list
all_sats_data <- do.call("rbind", lapply(filenames, read.csv, header = FALSE))
# add column headers
colnames(all_sats_data) <- c("Mission_Name", "Organization", "Organization_Type", "Nation", "Sat_Type", "Launch_Year", "Rocket", "Orbit", "Mission_Type")

write.csv(all_sats_data, "all_sats.csv")
```
